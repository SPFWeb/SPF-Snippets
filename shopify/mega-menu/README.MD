# SPF Websites Mega Menu

This Mega Menu is made using Uikit 3.0 for Shopify Sites based off of the [Canopy Theme](http://www.cleanthemes.co.uk/) by Clean Themes.

## Getting Started

To get started all you need is a Shopify that supports sections and a basic understanding of the liquid language.

### Prerequisites

For the Mega Menu to work you will need to add the core files for UiKit, you can add them by copying the following code into the head of your theme.liquid file.

```
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/uikit/3.0.0-beta.16/css/uikit.min.css" />
  <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
  <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/uikit/3.0.0-beta.16/js/uikit.min.js"></script>
  <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/uikit/3.0.0-beta.16/js/uikit-icons.min.js"></script>

```

### Installing

1. Create a new snippet under the name of main-navigation.liquid and paste the raw code from here to it.
2. Do the exact same for main-navigation-sublist.liquidand has_drop_down.liquid.
3. Once all snippets have been added to your shopify store copy the header schma toyour header.liquid and include 'main-navigation'.
